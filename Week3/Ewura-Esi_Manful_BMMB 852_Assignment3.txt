# BMMB 852 Assignment 3

# I chose the organism *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*

# I used NCBI Datasets (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/) to get the accession number (GCF_000195955.2) and downloaded the fna and the gff files from the command line

# Before downloading the files, I activated my bioinfo conda environment by typing
micromamba activate bioinfo

# I went ahead to update the ncbi datasets before starting the download by typing
micromamba update ncbi-datasets-cli jq

# I checked the summary or metadata of the genome using the accession number GCF_000195955.2  before downloading by typing 
datasets summary genome accession GCF_000195955.2 | jq


# Download the file
datasets download genome accession GCF_000195955.2 


# I noticed I didn't have the unzip command so I installed the unzip command before unzipping the file
micromamba install unzip

# Unzip the file
unzip ncbi_dataset.zip


# Download the gff3 and the gtf files (including additional information for the genome)
datasets download genome accession GCF_000195955.2 --include gff3,gtf
 

# View the top 10 lines of the gff file (I wanted to know the features present)
cat genomic.gff | head


# View all the annotation for only the genes
cat genomic.gff | awk ' $3=="gene" { print $0 }'


# Extract all intervals for genes and saved them into a different file called gene.gff to view them on IGV
cat genomic.gff | awk ' $3=="gene" { print $0 }' > gene.gff

# Making my own gff file manually (I named it my_own.gff)
code my_own.gff

# Obtain the chromosome accession for making my gff file 
cat GCF_000195955.2_ASM19595v2_genomic.fna | head -1
 

# I created my gff using by typing the following in vs code I created a custom GFF file with intervals representing hypothetical  regions of interest I visualized this file alongside the main annotations in IGV.
